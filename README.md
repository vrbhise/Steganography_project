Project Overview:
-This project allows users to securely hide and retrieve secret messages inside images using AES encryption combined with image steganography. The Tkinter GUI provides an easy-to-use interface for encryption and decryption.

Features:
1.AES Encryption & Decryption – Securely encrypts messages before hiding them in images.
2.Passcode Protection – Only users with the correct passcode can decrypt the message.
3.User-friendly GUI – Built with Tkinter for easy encryption & decryption.
4.Steganography – Uses image pixel values to hide encrypted messages.
5.Automatic Input Clearing – Ensures messages and passcodes are not left in input fields after encryption/decryption.

Requirements:
-Python 3.x must be installed on your system.

Install the required libraries using:
>pip install opencv-python numpy pycryptodome

Run gui.py file using :
>python gui.py
