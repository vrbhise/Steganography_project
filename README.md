Project Overview
This project allows users to securely hide and retrieve secret messages inside images using AES encryption combined with image steganography. The Tkinter GUI provides an easy-to-use interface for encryption and decryption.

 Features
âœ… AES Encryption & Decryption â€“ Securely encrypts messages before hiding them in images.
âœ… Passcode Protection â€“ Only users with the correct passcode can decrypt the message.
âœ… User-friendly GUI â€“ Built with Tkinter for easy encryption & decryption.
âœ… Steganography â€“ Uses image pixel values to hide encrypted messages.
âœ… Automatic Input Clearing â€“ Ensures messages and passcodes are not left in input fields after encryption/decryption.

Requirements
ðŸ“Œ Python 3.x must be installed on your system.
ðŸ“Œ Install the required libraries using:

pip install opencv-python numpy pycryptodome
